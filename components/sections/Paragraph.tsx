          I&apos;m passionate about the intersection of humans and technology, constantly inspired by great user experience and seamless design. Currently, I&apos;m deeply interested in natural language processing, voice AI, and recommender systems, exploring how these technologies shape human-computer interactions. Beyond tech, I channel my creativity into music production, crafting afro house, reggaeton, and house tracks. I love sports, especially football, and I&apos;m interested in longevity (exercising).
